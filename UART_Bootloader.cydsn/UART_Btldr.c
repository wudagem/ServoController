* Summary:
*  Receives the command. 
*
* Parameters:  
*  pData:    A pointer to the area to store the block of data received
*             from the device.
*  size:     Maximum size of the read buffer
*  count:    Pointer to an unsigned short variable to write the number
*             of bytes actually read.
*  timeOut:  Number of units to wait before returning because of a timeOut.
*            Timeout is measured in 10s of ms.
*
* Return: 
*  cystatus: This function will return CYRET_SUCCESS if at least one byte is received
*			 successfully within the timeout interval. If no data is received this 
*			 function will return CYRET_EMPTY.
*
* Theory: 
*  'receivedDataCount' is updated with number of bytes received in the UART RX 
*  interrupt routine. This variable is used to check whether some data is received 
*  within the timeout period specified in *.cydwr. If data is received before the timeout, 
*  the control will remain in another loop waiting for more data until no data is 
*  received for a BYTE2BYTE_TIME_OUT(2 ms) interval.
*
*  Note: Increase the BYTE2BYTE_TIME_OUT to 10 ms for baud rates less than 9600.  
* 
*  BYTE2BYTE_TIME_OUT is used for detecting timeout marking end of block data from host. 
*  This has to be set to a value which is greater than the expected maximum delay 
*  between two bytes during a block/packet transmission from the host. 
*  You have to account for the delay in hardware converters while calculating this value,
*  if you are using any USB-UART bridges.
