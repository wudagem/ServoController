*                           THEORY OF OPERATION
* The Bootlader uses UART interface to bootload a new project. The Switch on the 
* board needs to be pressed during power up to enter into the bootlader. The LED 
* on the board blinks every 500ms to indicate that the bootloader is active and 
* is ready for a bootload operation.
* Default UART Port Configuration for bootloading the PSoC 4 in CY8CKIT-049-42xx
* Baud Rate : 115200 bps
* Data Bits : 8
* Stop Bits : 1
* Parity    : None
* 
* Note: Debugging is disabled in the System DWR Editor. To enable debugging, change
*       the Debug Select to SWD in the System tab of the UART_Bootloader.cydwr file
